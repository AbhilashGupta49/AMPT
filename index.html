				Advances in Materials and Processing Technologies (AMPT) conference series was founded in 1990 at the Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland and AMPT conferences were held there in 1993, 1995, 1999 and 2003. Outside of Ireland it has been held in Portugal in 1997, Malaysia in 1998, Spain in 2001, Poland in 2004, USA in 2006, Korea in 2007, Bahrain in 2008 and Malaysia in 2009.

Last year AMPT2016 conference was held in November in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This year the AMPT2017 conference will take place in Chennai, India.<br/> 
The AMPT conference series provides a forum for academics, researchers, and practicing engineers to meet and exchange innovative ideas and information on all aspects of material processing technologies.<br/> 
A dedicated journal titled Journal of Advances in Materials and Processing Technologies (JAMPT) published by Taylor and Francis Publishers, publishes about 120 selected peer reviewed papers from each of the AMPT conferences in four regular issues. Other peer reviewed and selected papers will be published in a number of other journals and periodicals, such as Journal of Manufacturing Science & Technology, Advanced Materials Research and International Journal of Material Forming. <br/> 
As chairman of the AMPT Steering Committee I welcome colleagues to submit abstract of their research papers for presentation at the AMPT2017 conference and avail of this opportunity to get exposure of their research work/project at this international gathering of researchers from all over the world. Myself together with other members of the AMPT Steering Committee as well as the members of the Organising Committee chaired by Prof.  Padmanabhan R. will be very pleased to meet all the delegates at the conference in December 2017 VIT University - Chennai.<br/> <br/><br/>
